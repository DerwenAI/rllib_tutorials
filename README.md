# RLlib Tutorials

These _reinforcement learning_ tutorials use different environments from 
[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) to illustrate how to train policies 
in [RLlib](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html).

Use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run the
notebooks.
Connect into the directory for this repo, then launch JupyterLab with the
command line:

```
jupyter lab
```

## Tutorial Notebooks

  * `intro.ipynb` -- Introduction to RLlib (from [`rllib_exercises`](https://github.com/ray-project/tutorial/blob/master/rllib_exercises/rllib_colab.ipynb) by @edoakes)
  * `app_cartpole.ipynb` -- sample app based on the `CartPole-v0` environment from Gym
