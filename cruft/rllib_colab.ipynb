        "# RL Exercise - Markov Decision Processes\n",
        "\n",
        "**GOAL:** The goal of the exercise is to introduce the Markov Decision Process abstraction and to show how to use Markov Decision Processes in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The key abstraction in reinforcement learning is the Markov decision process (MDP).** An MDP models sequential interactions with an external environment. It consists of the following:\n",
        "- a **state space**\n",
        "- a set of **actions**\n",
        "- a **transition function** which describes the probability of being in a state $s'$ at time $t+1$ given that the MDP was in state $s$ at time $t$ and action $a$ was taken\n",
        "- a **reward function**, which determines the reward received at time $t$\n",
        "- a **discount factor** $\\gamma$\n",
        "\n",
        "More details are available [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process).\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** Reinforcement learning algorithms are often applied to problems that don't strictly fit into the MDP framework. In particular, situations in which the state of the environment is not fully observed lead to violations of the MDP assumption. Nevertheless, RL algorithms can be applied anyway.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Policies\n",
        "\n",
        "A **policy** is a function that takes in a **state** and returns an **action**. A policy may be stochastic (i.e., it may sample from a probability distribution) or it can be deterministic.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **goal of reinforcement learning** is to learn a **policy** for maximizing the cumulative reward in an MDP. That is, we wish to find a policy $\\pi$ which solves the following optimization problem\n",
        "\n",
        "\\begin{equation}\n",
        "\\arg\\max_{\\pi} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\gamma^t R_t(\\pi),\n",
        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "\n",
        "where $T$ is the number of steps taken in the MDP (this is a random variable and may depend on $\\pi$) and $R_t$ is the reward received at time $t$ (also a random variable which depends on $\\pi$).\n",
        "\n",
        "A number of algorithms are available for solving reinforcement learning problems. Several of the most widely known are [value iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Value_iteration), [policy iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process#Policy_iteration), and [Q learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning).\n",

        "## RL in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "The `gym` Python module provides MDP interfaces to a variety of simulators. For example, the CartPole environment interfaces with a simple simulator which simulates the physics of balancing a pole on a cart. The CartPole problem is described at https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0. This example fits into the MDP framework as follows.\n",
        "- The **state** consists of the position and velocity of the cart as well as the angle and angular velocity of the pole that is balancing on the cart.\n",
        "- The **actions** are to decrease or increase the cart's velocity by one unit.\n",
        "- The **transition function** is deterministic and is determined by simulating physical laws.\n",
        "- The **reward function** is a constant 1 as long as the pole is upright, and 0 once the pole has fallen over. Therefore, maximizing the reward means balancing the pole for as long as possible.\n",
